## Introduction
The purpose of this lab was to analyze basic electrical circuits by measuring voltages and currents in both series and parallel configurations.
This experiment aimed to verify Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) and Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) while also applying Thevenin’s theorem. 
and the superposition theorem to analyze electrical circuits. In this lab, we aimed to apply these fundamental principles by constructing and analyzing both series and parallel circuits. The experiment was designed to verify KVL and KCL through direct measurement of circuit parameters. Furthermore, Thevenin’s theorem was explored by determining the equivalent circuit parameters experimentally and comparing them to theoretical calculations.

## Methods
### Instruments
• A Digital Multimeter

• A DC Power supply

• A Soldering station

• A small piece of solder

• Solder protoboard

• Resistors: 1kΩ, 2.2 kΩ, 2.2 kΩ, 5.1 kΩ, 4.7 kΩ, 6.8 kΩ, 15 kΩ, 220 kΩ


The lab was divided into two main tasks:

First, we learned soldering techniques by building a simple series circuit on a solder protoboard. Second, we analyzed a circuit by measuring and comparing theoretical and experimental values to confirm the validity of fundamental circuit laws. By conducting this lab, we not only reinforced our theoretical understanding of circuit laws but also developed hands-on skills in circuit construction, soldering, and precise electrical measurements. The experimental results were expected to align with theoretical predictions, demonstrating the accuracy and applicability of these fundamental electrical concepts in real-world engineering.
### Objective 1: Learn soldering techniques by building a simple circuit on a solder protoboard

### Objective 2: Analyze a circuit to verify Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) and Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL), and to apply Thevenin’s and superposition theorems to the analysis of electrical circuits


## Results
Verification of Kirchhoff’s Laws:
The measured currents confirmed KCL, as the sum of currents entering and leaving each node was approximately equal.
The measured voltages confirmed KVL, as the total voltage drop matched the supplied voltage.
Power Analysis:
The power supplied by the source was approximately equal to the total power dissipated across all resistors, confirming conservation of energy in the circuit. Thevenin and Norton Equivalence:
The measured Thevenin Voltage (VTH) and Thevenin Resistance (RTH) were close to the calculated values. The measured short-circuit current (IN) confirmed the theoretical Norton equivalent.
Sources of Error:
Measurement errors due to DMM inaccuracies. Component tolerances affecting resistance values. Connection issues in soldered circuits.

## Discussion

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this lab successfully demonstrated the fundamental electrical circuit laws, including Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL). The experimental results closely aligned with theoretical calculations, validating the principles of circuit analysis.
Additionally, we gained hands-on experience in soldering and circuit measurement techniques. The Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits were analyzed and verified through direct measurement and calculations. Any discrepancies were likely due to component tolerances, measurement limitations, or human errors.
This experiment reinforced the importance of accurate circuit measurements and understanding of basic electrical laws in engineering applications.
